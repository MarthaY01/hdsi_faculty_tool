## Our Goal 
<em> Here we will write the motivation of our project, basically a portion of the introduction of our project report. </em> 

## Data Collection
<em> Here we will talk about Dimensions, Google Scholars and how we used the manually filled out CSV to get our abstracts </em> 

## Abstracts as Data
<em> More on our data, specifically why we used abstracts, and why we believe they are representative of a faculty's work (address how authors might not use the field label on the abstract) </em>
  
## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
<em> Here we will talk about Topic Modelling and LDA </em>

## Our Dashboard
<em> Here we will include how the version 1.0 of the Sankey looked, with no labels and no color coding </em>

## Topic Labelling
<em> Here we will discuss how in order to improve our product, we obtained labels from Google Scholar and Dimensions to categorize articles and faculty, but how we still kept the topic words in order to be more exact with the topic distinction </em>


## Easy Search Tool
<em> Here we will talk about the Front End Element of our project, and how it is easy to use for any audience, specially those who might not be familiar with the Sankedy </em>

## Maintaning a Workflow and Future Use
<em> Here we will talk about how the code was changed in order to be upkept easily, and how addition or deletion of faculty will be easy and can be done once a year. We will also mention the reason of this (faculty publishes every year).
